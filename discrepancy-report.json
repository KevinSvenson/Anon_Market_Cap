Horizen's vision extends beyond simple transactions to include private messaging, domain frontiers, and a sidechain platform (Zendoo) for deploying decentralized applications.

The sidechain architecture adds additional privacy possibilities through isolated environments. However, like Zcash, privacy is optional rather than mandatory, and the actual privacy achieved depends on shielded pool usage. The large node network enhances resistance to network-level analysis. Strong cryptographic foundation with proven technology warrants High rating despite optional nature."
